# Space Man

I did a 2D platform video game, using some aseets by Platzi, that they shared in the course that I follow. It have a solution to let the system put blocks of sub-levels inside the first level, I just had to design the sub-levels than I just develop the algorithm to make it real and the game count the score of the character using the distance traveled, he can lost life and poison power to let the character jump a litle bit more. The enmys are rockets that interferes with the character, and originally the carachter had to run automatically, but I add the behaviour to use a free horizontal movement.
